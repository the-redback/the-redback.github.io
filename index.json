They also bring decentralization and lose coupling across self-contained system parts. Since these systems likely evolve in a decentralized manner, they need to be monitored to identify when possibly poorly designed extensions deteriorate the overall system quality. For monolith systems, such tasks have been commonly addressed through static analysis. However, given the decentralization and possible language diversity across microservices, static analysis tools are lacking. On the other hand, there are available tools commonly used by practitioners that offer centralized logging, tracing, and metric collection for microservices. In this paper, we assess the opportunity to combine current dynamic analysis tools with anomaly detection in the form of quality metrics and anti-patterns. We develop a tool prototype that we use to assess a large microservice system benchmark demonstrating the feasibility and potential of such an approach.","tags":["Computer Science - Software Engineering"],"title":"Using Microservice Telemetry Data for System Dynamic Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Md Rofiqul Islam","Abdullah Al Maruf","Tomas Cerny"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657224469,"objectID":"1541abdc1800e5a6394ed735c98c7e25","permalink":"https://maruftuhin.com/publication/electronics-11121880/","publishdate":"2022-07-07T20:07:49.021734Z","relpermalink":"/publication/electronics-11121880/","section":"publication","summary":"One of the most significant impediments to the long-term maintainability of software applications is code smells. Keeping up with the best coding practices can be difficult for software developers, which might lead to performance throttling or code maintenance concerns. As a result, it is imperative that large applications be regularly monitored for performance issues and code smells, so that these issues can be corrected promptly. Resolving code smells in software systems can be done in a variety of ways, but doing so all at once would be prohibitively expensive and can be out of budget. Prioritizing these solutions are therefore critical. The majority of current research prioritizes code smells according to the type of smell they cause. This method, however, is not sufficient because of a lack of knowledge regarding the frequency of code usage and code changeability behavior. Even the most complex programs have some components that are more important than others. Maintaining the functionality of certain parts is essential since they are often used. Identifying and correcting code smells in places that are frequently utilized and subject to rapid change should take precedence over other code smells. A novel strategy is proposed for finding frequently used and change-prone areas in a codebase by combining business logic, heat map information, and commit history analysis in this study. It examines the codebase, commits, and log files of Java applications to identify business processes, heat map graphs, and severity levels of various types of code smells and their commit history. This is done in order to present a comprehensive, efficient, and resource-friendly technique for identifying and prioritizing performance throttling with also handling code maintenance concerns.","tags":[],"title":"Code Smell Prioritization with Business Process Mining and Static Code Analysis: A Case Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexander Bakhtin","Abdullah Al Maruf","Tomas Cerny","Davide Taibi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657224468,"objectID":"eeaa3bef3f10e4cc68252d099f35ba68","permalink":"https://maruftuhin.com/publication/bakhtin-survey-2022/","publishdate":"2022-07-07T20:07:48.709842Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bakhtin-survey-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"It is well recognized that design patterns improve system development and maintenance in many aspects.

The highly decentralized approach to software development consists of relatively independent services, which provides benefits such as faster deployment cycles, better scalability, and good separation of concerns among services. With this new architecture, one can naturally expect a broad range of advancements and simplifications over legacy systems. However, microservice system design remains challenging, as it is still difficult for engineers to understand the system module boundaries. Thus, understanding and explaining the microservice systems might not be as easy as initially thought. This study aims to classify recently published approaches and techniques to analyze microservice systems. It also looks at the evolutionary perspective of such systems and their analysis. Furthermore, the identified approaches target various challenges and goals, which this study analyzed. Thus, it provides the reader with a roadmap to the discipline, tools, techniques, and open challenges for future work. It provides a guide towards choices when aiming for analyzing cloud-native systems. The results indicate five analytical approaches commonly used in the literature, possibly in combination, towards problems classified into seven categories.","tags":[],"title":"On Microservice Analysis and Architecture Evolution: A Systematic Mapping Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vincent Bushong","Dipta Das","Abdullah Al Maruf","Tomas Cerny"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657224469,"objectID":"2f29ebfd4298f14dfeda6c48684e0138","permalink":"https://maruftuhin.com/publication/9678749/","publishdate":"2022-07-07T20:07:49.326056Z","relpermalink":"/publication/9678749/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Using Static Analysis to Address Microservice Architecture Reconstruction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abdullah Al Maruf","Noah Lambaria","Amr S.
