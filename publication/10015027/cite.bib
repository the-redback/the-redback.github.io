 abstract = {In the world of microservices, companies must be able to create systems that operate in the most efficient way. To achieve this, anti-patterns must be avoided because of their detriment to the quality of the system. Some of the most troubling anti-patterns are hard to detect because of their appearance at runtime. Effectively removing anti-patterns from a system requires dynamic analysis because of the large size of microservice-based systems. While the detection of anti-patterns is helpful, being able to visualize them offers a great benefit to companies working with microservices. Seeing how the overall system is flowing and recognizing the existence of anti-patterns can help improve microservice-based systems. In this paper, a systematic mapping study was performed to find the current state of research on visualizing anti-patterns in microservices from the dynamic perspective. Several hundred papers were examined and a total of 31 were found to be relevant to the research topic. The papers, when analyzed, revealed that there are mechanisms to detect anti-patterns at runtime in microservices, and there are also mechanisms for visualizing the architecture of a microservice-based system. This studyâ€™s findings could help to identify and remove anti-patterns that occur during runtime in microservices, as well as a means of visualizing these anti-patterns.},
